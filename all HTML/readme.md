          <p>The Vinewood Club Garage is an extensive new expansion to meet the vehicular storage needs of The Vinewood
            Club's clientele. On top of all your garage space in existing properties, GTA+ Members now have access to the
            full 100 vehicle storage capacity of this new location in Pillbox Hill, right in the core of downtown Los
            Santos.
    
            The latest members-only perk from The Vinewood Club, you can now store up to a whopping 100 vehicles across five
            floors in this state-of-the-art facility. Paired with the new vehicle management menu, The Vinewood Club Garage
            provides the most spacious and organized vehicle storage experience to date.
    
            GTA+ Members have access to The Vinewood Club Garage's full storage capacity, including the ability to add and
            remove vehicles via the Interaction Menu. You’ll retain permanent access to all vehicles housed in the garage,
            however storage of any additional vehicles will be suspended if your GTA+ subscription has lapsed.
